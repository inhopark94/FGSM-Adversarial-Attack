# FGSM adversarial attach for both of white and black box adversarial attack.

This is about the adversarial attack and defense
Main content is attack, defense will be uploaded soon

python version 3.7.5


make a new anaconda enviroment : conda create -n name python=3.7.5
pytorch, torchvision, cudatoolkit download : conda install pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit=10.2 -c pytorch (pytorch hompage explains details)

matplotlib : conda install matplotlib

you can write the code in the directory where you download the file.

python WhiteBox.py
python BlackBox.py

The WhiteBox.py file is about the fgsm attack which is very famous.
The code was made with reference to the pytorch site.
